### React Frontend

The stream tool allows us to control and manage overlays (e.g scoreboard/camera) and text displayed on those overlays in real time (websockets) and from anywhere (webserver). It can also manage defined commands for [nightbot](https://nightbot.tv/).

This is the client, which connects to the server ([coldlink/hbk-stream-server](https://github.com/coldlink/hbk-stream-server)) to connect to, syncronise, and publish data, all using websockets.

## Setup

### Technology

- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

### Development

Setting the client up for development is straightforward, be sure to set up the [server](https://github.com/coldlink/hbk-stream-server) first though!

1. Clone the repo

```sh
# using ssh
$ git clone git@github.com:coldlink/hbk-stream-front.git
## or using https
$ git clone https://github.com/coldlink/hbk-stream-front.git
```

2. Open the folder

```sh
$ cd hbk-stream-dront
```

3. Install Dependencies

```sh
# using yarn (recommened)
$ yarn
# or npm
$ npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables

```sh
# create .env file by copying the .env.example
$ cp .env.example .env
# then add the STREAM_SERVER parameter
# by default the local server runs at "http://localhost:3000" but you can also put in a remote server.
```

5. Start the dev environment

```sh
$ yarn dev # or npm run dev

# if everything has worked correctly you should see something like
[18:25:40] Starting compilation in watch mode...

Server running at http://localhost:1234
âœ¨  Built in 3.67s.
```

6. Start development, the local dev server runs by default on `http://localhost:1234`.

### Deployment

We use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as our build tool, so referring to there for the build process is helpful!

You can create a production build by running

```sh
$ yarn build
```

This creates a static production build in the `dist` folder, which you can then deploy on any static site.

If you're deploying to a server, be sure to set the `STREAM_SERVER` environment variable to point to the remote server first in `.env` before building and deploying!

We use [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) as the platform we run on, so the scripts in `package.json` are setup for that, but you can deploy to anywhere.
To deploy to CapRover, it's as sinple as running `yarn deploy` if you have a CapRover server setup.

## Development Tips

### Entry Files

The `index.html` in the `./src` folder is the entry pointed used by parcel. This calls `index.tsx` which sets up the React SPA. For global styles use the `index.css`, but this should rarely need to be changed, since nearly everything should be done with local styles.

### Theme

The `./src/theme` folder has the definition of any styles that can be reused, simply import the `theme` object, and use with the `styles` object and `withStyles` to attach it to the `classes` prop.

### UI

The `./src/ui` folder contains everything related to the react application. `App` is where the routes are defined, so if you're adding a new page, be sure to route it here. `Components` has reusuable components, used in multiple roots, or multiple places. `Routes` has the pages to be displayed, and everything related to that. `Services` has reusable services used by multiple routes, in our case `socket`.
